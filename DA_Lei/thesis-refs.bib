  review = {EASE propose an efficient and adaptive keyword search method for indexing
	and querying large collection of heterogenous data. To achieve high
	efficiency in processing keyword queries, we first model unstructured,
	semi-structured and structured data as graphs.
	
	EASE can be universally applied to unstructured data(e.g., text documents),
	semi-structured data(e.g., XML documents), structured data(e.g.,
	relational databases) and graph-structured data(e.g., RDF). 
	
	Providing both effective and efficient search ability over such heterogeneous
	collections within a single search engine remains a big challenge.
	
	EASE model unstructured, semi-structured and structured data as graphs,
	with nodes being documents, elements and tuples respectively, and
	edges being hyperlinks, parent-child relationships(or IDREFS) and
	primary-foreingn-key relationships respectively.},
